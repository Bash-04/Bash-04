### Hello and welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹
<hr>
My name is Bas Bakens and I am 17 years old. 
<br>
I live in the south of the Netherlands and in Juli 2021 I started coding my first project which became my own portfolio site.
<br>
Check out my portfolio site. I'm still working on at the moment, so it isn't fully done yet!
